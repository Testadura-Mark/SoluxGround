SoluxGround is a small, powerful Bash framework designed for system engineers,
developers, automation builders, and anyone who wants clean, structured, reliable
shell scripts — without the usual mess or over-engineered tooling.

It provides:

- A predictable bootstrap lifecycle  
- Robust argument parsing  
- Clear, styled UI output  
- Practical helpers for deployment and file management  
- A consistent template system for building new scripts  

SoluxGround is built on decades of practical scripting experience, with the simple
mission of making Bash *civilized*.

## 🧭 Philosophy

SoluxGround was created to bring clarity, discipline, and reliability to Bash scripting.
Instead of relying on heavy toolchains or complex automation frameworks, it focuses on:

- **Simplicity** — Everything is explicit, readable, and easy to follow  
- **Consistency** — All scripts follow the same lifecycle and structure  
- **Predictability** — No hidden magic; behavior is always traceable  
- **Maintainability** — Designed for long-term use, not quick hacks  
- **Practicality** — Built from real-world operational experience, not trends  

The goal is simple:  
**Make Bash civilized again** — without losing the power and flexibility that make Unix scripting useful.

## 📁 Repository Structure
SoluxGround is organized around a `target-root` directory, which mirrors the filesystem
layout of the environment it will be installed into. Deployment is straightforward:
the entire structure is copied to the target system, placing framework files under
`/usr/local/lib/testadura` and creating executable symlinks in `/usr/local/bin`.

The repository layout:

## 🧰 Included Tools

SoluxGround ships with two key tools that streamline scripting workflows:

### **1. create-workspace.sh**
Creates a new script workspace based on SoluxGround conventions.

It:
- Generates a folder structure
- Copies a template (full or minimal)
- Optionally adds argument parsing and config support
- Ensures consistent bootstrap + constructor setup  

This is the recommended way to start new scripts.

### **2. deploy-workspace.sh**
Deploys the entire `target-root` directory onto a real system.

It:
- Mirrors directory structure under `/usr/local`
- Preserves permissions
- Supports dry-run mode
- Detects updates cleanly
- Safely installs Testadura/SoluxGround framework files

This is the mechanism used to install SoluxGround or update existing deployments.
